# Fitness Tracker App

// Inspiration

The inspirtation behind this project was being able to create an app that provides guidence, organization, and motivation to any user starting or well on their fitness journey. Tools as such we believe will help the community thrive and encourage them to reach their goals.

// Overview

Our app features users the ability to create workouts(Type, the load amount, and number of reps)upon login and a valid registration. Users will also be able to delete any workouts they no longer wish to keep. Users will only be able to see workouts created by them. Once satisfied, users can logout at any time while still having all their created workouts saved. Just log back in, and the user can resume right where they left off.
